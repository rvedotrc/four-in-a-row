Rules of Four-In-A-Row
======================

(also known as "Connect Four")

A turn-based game for two players.
  
Each player is identified by tokens of a particular colour, Red and Yellow.

The game board is a grid, 7 cells wide and 6 cells high.

Red goes first.

Each player places a token of their colour into the grid.
Tokens can only be placed in the lower-most empty cell of any given column.
Each cell can only contain a single token.
Once placed, a token remains in position for the remainder of the game.

Thus, the player's decision is to choose of the seven columns to play in
(but it is not possible to play in a column which is already full).

The aim of the game is to create a line (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally)
of four or more tokens of your colour, without gaps.

The game ends as soon as one player achieves this goal (in which case, that player wins),
or when no lines have been made but the board is full (in which case, no more moves are possible, and the result is a draw).

Specification
-------------

Display output to System.out (flushed), and receive input from System.in.

At the start of each turn, display the current state of the board.

Then display whose turn it is by outputting either "Red's turn" or "Yellow's turn".

Then read input, expecting a column number 1-7 (1 being the leftmost column).

If the move not valid, show "Try again", and go back to reading input.
If the move is valid, show "OK".

Add the player's token to the chosen column.

If the game is over, display "Game over", then the current state of the board, then one of "Red wins", "Yellow wins", or "It's a draw", then exit.

If the game is not over, start the next turn.

Displaying the board
--------------------

When displaying the board, use a simple character grid: six lines of output, each line containing seven characters.
Use "r" for a cell occupied by a red token, "y" for yellow, and "." for an empty cell.

For example:

.......
.......
.......
....r..
....r..
y..ry..

Here's a board of a game that's just been won by yellow:

.......
.......
.......
.......
.rrr...
ryyyy..
